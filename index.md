## Who Is Timebreez For?

### For Centre Managers and Administrators

You spend hours each week juggling spreadsheets, chasing staff about leave requests, and manually building payroll. Timebreez gives you:

- A visual roster builder to plan coverage across all rooms
- Instant visibility of who's off, who's in, and who's available
- Leave approvals that show schedule impact before you decide
- Automatic payroll reconciliation - no more manual counting

### For Childcare Staff

You want to know when you're working and how much leave you have left, without having to ask or check multiple systems. Timebreez gives you:

- Your personal schedule sent to WhatsApp every Sunday
- Morning reminders so you never forget a shift
- Request leave anytime from your phone
- Always know your remaining leave balance
