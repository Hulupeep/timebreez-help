#### Step 2: Set Up Your Rooms

Rooms are where your staff work - Baby Room, Toddlers, Preschool, etc.

1. Go to **Settings > Rooms**
2. Click **Add Room**
3. For each room, enter:
   - Room name (e.g., "Baby Room")
   - Typical operating hours
   - Capacity (number of children)
   - Ratio requirement (staff-to-child ratio for your reference)

{: .note }
Room ratios are shown for your reference when building rosters. Compliance tracking remains in your existing compliance system (like TeachKloud).

#### Step 4: Set Leave Allowances

For each employee, configure their leave entitlements:

## Quick Tips for Administrators

### Building Rosters Efficiently

- **Use templates**: If your roster is similar each week, copy from a previous week
- **Check leave first**: The roster will show approved leave - build around it
- **Watch the warnings**: Timebreez highlights gaps and conflicts

### Handling Leave Requests

- **Review the impact**: Each request shows which shifts are affected
- **Check the balance**: You'll see if they have enough days
- **Respond promptly**: Staff get notified immediately when you decide

### Keeping Data Accurate

- **Review weekly**: Check the payroll summary before exporting
- **Handle no-shows**: When staff call in sick, make sure it's logged
- **Update allowances**: At leave year renewal, update everyone's balance
