# About Timebreez
{: .fs-9 }

Why we built Timebreez and the problems it solves for childcare centres.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## The Problem: Too Many Systems, Too Much Manual Work

Running a childcare centre means juggling multiple systems that don't communicate with each other:

- **Leave management** in one system (like Timetastic)
- **Staff rosters** in Excel spreadsheets
- **Clock-in data** in your access system (like Paxton)
- **Communication** via WhatsApp groups
- **Payroll** manually compiled from all of the above

### The Weekly Struggle

Every week, centre managers face the same challenges:

1. **Build the roster** in Excel, trying to remember who requested leave
2. **Screenshot the roster** and send it to WhatsApp for staff to see
3. **Chase staff** who forgot to log they were sick or left early
4. **Cross-reference** leave records with clock-in data
5. **Manually create** the payroll sheet, hoping nothing gets missed
6. **Handle the corrections** when something inevitably does get missed

{: .warning }
This manual process typically takes several hours every week and is prone to errors that can affect staff pay and compliance.

## The Solution: One System, One Source of Truth

Timebreez brings everything together in one place:

```
BEFORE                              AFTER
┌─────────────┐                     ┌─────────────┐
│ Timetastic  │                     │             │
├─────────────┤                     │             │
│   Excel     │   ───────────►      │  TIMEBREEZ  │
├─────────────┤                     │             │
│  WhatsApp   │                     │             │
├─────────────┤                     └─────────────┘
│   Paxton    │
└─────────────┘
```

### How Timebreez Helps

| Problem | Timebreez Solution |
|---------|-------------------|
| Staff forget to log absences | System detects when someone doesn't clock in and sends them a WhatsApp asking if they're OK |
| No visibility of leave balances | Staff and managers see remaining days at any time |
| Roster only visible at work | Personal schedules sent to WhatsApp weekly |
| Part-time staff tracking is rigid | Flexible hourly and daily tracking options |
| Multiple data entry points | Enter once, flows everywhere |
| Hours spent on payroll prep | Automatic reconciliation and export |

## Who We Built This For

### Centre Managers (like Sandra)

You manage dozens of staff across multiple rooms. Your goals are simple:

- Build the weekly roster efficiently
- Approve leave without breaking coverage
- Know who's in the building at any time
- Produce accurate payroll data without spending hours on it

**Your interface:** The Timebreez web dashboard on your desktop.

### Childcare Staff

You work across Baby Room, Toddlers, Preschool, or other rooms. You want to:

- Know when and where you're working this week
- Request time off from home (not just during your shift)
- Know how many leave days you have left
- Get reminded about tomorrow's shift

**Your interface:** WhatsApp notifications + optional calendar sync.

## How It Works

### The Weekly Flow with Timebreez

1. **Manager builds roster** using drag-and-drop (Monday)
2. **System sends schedules** to each staff member via WhatsApp (Sunday evening)
3. **Staff arrive for shifts**, clock in on existing system (daily)
4. **System detects** if someone hasn't arrived when expected (daily)
5. **Staff who don't show** get a WhatsApp asking if they're OK (daily)
6. **If sick**, they reply "SICK" and it's automatically logged
7. **Manager reviews** the week and exports payroll-ready data (Friday)

### Leave Request Flow

1. Staff sends WhatsApp message or uses the app to request leave
2. Manager sees the request with:
   - How many days requested
   - Current leave balance
   - Impact on scheduled shifts
3. Manager approves or denies with one click
4. Staff receives WhatsApp notification of the decision
5. Leave balance updates automatically

## Our Approach

### Built for Childcare

We understand that childcare centres have unique needs:

- **Room-based scheduling** - not just shifts, but where staff are needed
- **Compliance awareness** - knowing you need enough qualified staff
- **Part-time workforce** - handling mix of full-time, part-time, and hourly staff
- **Simple for staff** - many staff aren't tech-savvy, so WhatsApp works perfectly

### Mobile-First for Staff

We chose WhatsApp as the primary staff interface because:

- Everyone already has it
- No app to download or remember
- Works on any phone
- Notifications actually get read

### Web Dashboard for Managers

Centre managers need to:

- See the big picture (all rooms, all staff)
- Make quick changes (drag and drop)
- Approve requests efficiently (one-click approval)
- Export data (payroll-ready formats)

A proper web dashboard on a computer is the right tool for this job.
