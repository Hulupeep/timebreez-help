{: .fs-9 }

Learn how to view your schedule, request time off, and stay connected with Timebreez.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Getting Started

Welcome to Timebreez! Your manager has invited you to the platform. Here's everything you need to know about using Timebreez as a staff member.

### How Timebreez Works for You

Timebreez sends you information through **WhatsApp**, so you don't need to learn a new app or remember to check a website. You'll receive:

- Your weekly schedule (sent Sunday evening)
- Morning reminders before your shifts
- Notifications when your leave is approved or denied
- Alerts if something changes

You can also:

- Request time off by messaging WhatsApp
- Check your leave balance anytime
- View your full schedule in a calendar

{: .note }
Most staff use WhatsApp for everything. But if you prefer, you can also access Timebreez through a web browser at [app.timebreez.com](https://app.timebreez.com).

**Via the Web:**

1. Go to [app.timebreez.com](https://app.timebreez.com)
2. Log in with your email
3. Your schedule appears on the **My Schedule** page

### Understanding Your Schedule

Your schedule shows:

| Information | Example |
|-------------|---------|
| **Date** | Monday 27 January |
| **Time** | 8:30 AM - 4:30 PM |
| **Room** | Baby Room |
| **Break** | 30 min unpaid |
| **Notes** | Sarah on break cover |

### Weekly Schedule Message

Every Sunday evening, you'll receive your week ahead via WhatsApp:

> Hi Mary! Here's your week ahead:
>
> **MON 27 Jan**
> 8:30-4:30 | Baby Room
>
> **TUE 28 Jan**
> 9:00-5:00 | Toddler Room

## Morning Reminders

### What You'll Receive

On days you're working, you'll get a reminder in the morning (usually around 7 AM):

> Good morning Mary!
>
> You're on at 8:30 today in Baby Room.
>
> Reminders:
> - Clock in on Paxton when you arrive
> - Sarah is on break cover
>
> Have a great day!

### Why This Helps

- Never forget you have an early shift
- Know which room you're in before you arrive
- Get useful reminders for the day

If you'd prefer not to receive morning reminders, let your manager know and they can turn them off for you.
