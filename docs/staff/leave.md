>
> **Annual Leave**
> - Allowance: 20 days
> - Used: 4 days
> - Remaining: 16 days
>
> **Sick Leave** (this year)
> - Used: 2 days
>
> Your leave year resets on April 1st.

2. Go to **My Leave**
3. See your balances at the top of the page

## Understanding Your Balance

### Annual Leave

This is your paid holiday entitlement:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Allowance** | Total days you get per year (e.g., 20 days) |
| **Used** | Days you've already taken |
| **Pending** | Days you've requested but not yet approved |
| **Remaining** | Days available = Allowance - Used |

### Leave Year

Your leave year might run:

- **Calendar year**: January 1 - December 31
- **Financial year**: April 1 - March 31
- **Anniversary**: From your start date

Check with your manager if you're unsure when your leave year resets.

{: .important }
At the end of your leave year, unused days may expire or carry over depending on your centre's policy. Check with your manager.

### Sick Leave

Sick days are typically tracked separately. When you're unwell:

1. Let your manager know (or reply "SICK" to a no-show alert)
2. The sick day is logged in the system
3. You can see your sick day history in your leave summary

---

## After You Submit a Request

### Waiting for Approval

Your request goes to your manager who will:

1. Check your balance
2. See if you're scheduled to work those days
3. Consider team coverage
4. Approve or deny

{: .note }
Most requests are processed within a day or two. For urgent requests, let your manager know directly.

### When Your Request Is Approved

You'll receive a WhatsApp message:

> Good news! Your time off has been approved.
>
> December 15-16 (2 days Annual Leave)
>
> You now have 14 days remaining this year.

Your balance updates automatically.

### When Your Request Is Denied

You'll receive a message with an explanation:

> Hi Mary, unfortunately your leave request for December 15-16 couldn't be approved.
>
> Reason: We're already short-staffed that week due to other leave.
>
> Alternative: December 20-21 are available if those dates work for you.
>
> Please speak with your manager if you have questions.

## Tips for Leave Requests

### Do

- Request as early as possible
- Check your balance before requesting
- Be flexible with dates if possible
- Let your manager know if something is urgent

### Don't

- Assume it's approved until you hear back
- Book non-refundable travel before approval
- Request during busy periods if avoidable
- Forget to cancel requests you no longer need

---

## Common Questions

### "How much notice do I need to give?"

This depends on your centre's policy. Common rules:

- 2 weeks notice for annual leave
- More notice for longer periods
- Sick leave: as soon as you know

### "Can I take half days?"

Ask your manager. Some centres allow this, others only full days.

### "What if I get sick on annual leave?"

Contact your manager. Some centres will convert the sick days so you don't lose annual leave.

### "Can I carry over unused leave?"

This depends on your centre's policy. Check with your manager before your leave year ends.

### "Why was my request denied?"

Common reasons:

- Too many people already off
- Critical period (inspections, holidays)
- Not enough balance
- Not enough notice

Your denial message will include the reason. Talk to your manager if you need clarification.

## If You're Unwell

### Calling In Sick

If you wake up unwell:

1. **Reply to the no-show alert** (if you receive one): Just send "SICK"
2. **Or contact your manager** directly by phone or WhatsApp

### What Happens

1. Your manager logs the sick day
2. The shift is marked as sick leave
3. You'll see it in your leave history
4. Get well soon!

{: .important }
Always let someone know if you can't come in. A quick "SICK" reply takes 2 seconds and helps everyone plan.
